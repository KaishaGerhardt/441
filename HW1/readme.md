describing your experience and response to the homework

Its been longer than I remembered the last time I worked with HTML, and I did struggle more than I like to admit.
I think I was overwhelmed and nervous with where to start, but looking at the example helped!
I began to remember more of what I did in Web design course and I got excited to decorate the webpage with other tricks.
Overall, I think the more I do, the more embedded it will become.
