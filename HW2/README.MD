Write a reflection of what was created by you compared to what ChatGPT or Copilot created for you. 
Also take some time to think about how you would feel if you only used the output from a generative AI model. Do you think you could adequately explain the code that was written? Do you think that the work is still yours?


    I used ChatGPT to see the difference and how it would generate the script.
    Unless I read the homework wrong, the response to the homework when placed into ChatGPT was more "complex" than necessary. It did provide a decent understanding and example of how to format to an extent but did not fully understand the homework. I have used ChatGPT for coding before - when working in Unity - and it fairly did create the script that I needed but it would not integrate in well all the time. In this case, I would say it explained adequately. However, I don't believe that I could call it my own work since it was generated through previous works, I simply asked the question.
