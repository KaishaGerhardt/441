        You awaken on the warm dirt covered ground, your head pounds and your sight blurry. 
        <br/>
        Its takes you a moment to gain your footing and focus your eyes.
        <br/>
        You stumble up from the ground to be faced with a Strange Man.
        <br/>
        His eyes, hidden by brim of his hat.
        His teeth beared and grinning. He walks up to you.
        <br/>
        "Howdy There Partner, Ye seem lost?"
