For this week I did play with ChatGPT to see how it could implement the criteria for this week's assignment. 
I still try to use the program as a tool but I find it sometimes not as helpful when I think it will, it helps but when you are confused on what its not functioning, I shouldn't rely on ChatGPT to completely fix it, instead its better to learn from examples and I did talk with some fellow students with their work as well which is another helpful resource.
